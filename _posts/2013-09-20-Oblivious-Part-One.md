Fire burned in his chest, thrashing against the ribcage as if trying to escape.  Around him there was only darkness and he realized he couldn‘t feel his eyelids, not knowing if they were open or closed.

The world shifted and darkness became light, the fire in his chest subsiding. His eyelids were heavy and he felt an uncontrollable urge to close them again, but he resisted and looked through the narrow visors of his face at an autumn-stained field, cascading like a wide river of grass. He was moving across the field, his hands being pulled by someone or something, rough stalks scratching his naked backside. The world faded again.

Darkness returned and as did the fire within. Was this a dream? Or was it reality, making him slip away into a delusional world of grass and sunlight to escape the pain?  He couldn‘t tell.

His eyes opened slightly and he watched for a moment as a different world flew past. Women and children with pale faces and serious expressions watching him, staring at him as they stood outside their tent-like houses with roofs of grass. Who were they? Creatures of the deep parts of his mind? People from his past? He couldn‘t recall them, but he felt their significance. 

“Paho-Manaal!” shouted one of the voices around him. Others were shouting at him too but he couldn’t make out their words. 

His eyes closed again for what felt like only a moment. They shot wide open as searing pain ripped at his abdomen. A strong scent of grasses and herbs filled his nostrils and he looked around slowly but panicked. His vision was blurred but he could see that he was inside somewhere and no longer moving, and he noticed a moving shape by his side, hovering over his limp body. 

“Stop stirring, fool,” said a female voice, soft and delicate. 

He stayed still for a moment, allowing his eyes to slowly adjust to the room around him. The woman’s form became clearer and he watched as her face appeared before him. Her skin was pale as snow, her hair black as tar and her eyes carried a strong crimson hue. The sleeves of her quilted garb were rolled up, much of her arms sprayed with blood. Who’s blood? He raised his head a little and caught a glance of her hands, treating a wound on his stomach. She had placed some kind of leaves over the wounded area and was in the process of smearing on a thick, clear liquid that filled the room with a foul odor. 

“Wh-“ he began but his dry throat ambushed him, sending him into a coughing fit. 

“Drink.” She handed him a bowl of murky water and he took it, swallowing whatever didn’t run down the sides of his face. 

“Who are you?” he said, his throat painfully rasp. 

“Kalea,” she said, her voice sharp and her attention still fixed on the wound. 

“Where am I?” 

She stopped what she was doing and looked at him, her eyebrows slightly raised. “This is Paalu.” 

“Paalu?” he asked, not recognizing the word. 

“Fool… you do not know Paalu?” She eyed him as if he’d said the stupidest thing she’d heard. “Paalu is the greatest of the Ihmer cities. You must be from far away. Where do you come from?”

He stared at her for a moment, realizing he had no answer for her. “I don’t know.” 

“How can you not know?” 

“I can’t remember.”
 
“Do you have a name?” 

“I do…” 

“What is it?” 

“I don’t know.” He closed his eyes, feeling the frustration rising as he came to know that he remembered nothing of himself.

“Interesting,” said Kalea, rubbing her chin thoughtfully, leaving it smudged with his blood. “Those who found you say you were dead at first and then came to life as they hauled you into the city.” 

“How could they be sure I was dead?” 

“We are the Ihmer. We know many things but above all we know death.” As she spoke he noticed one of her front teeth was chipped, her lower lip was chopped and a scar edged from her forehead, over her left eyebrow and down to the cheek. “They called you Paho-Manaal.” 

“I heard someone say that!” He gazed into her eyes, his own wide with curiosity. “What does it mean?”

“It’s hard to explain… Paho-Manaal is a type of abyssal spirit, torn from our oldest tales. I don’t think you are what they say. To me you seem more of a fool who’s lost his way.” 

“I hope you don’t intend to call me that from now on.” 

“No,” she said. “I will call you Tau-Maaton… one who has seen his death.”

“Tau-Maaton,” he repeated her words. “I don’t know why, but I like how it sounds.” 

“Here,” she said as he handed him another bowl of water. “You need to stay hydrated.”
 
He nodded as he took the bowl in his hands. “Why do we understand each other? Am I fluent in your tongue?”

“Don’t think so highly of yourself,” she said with a smirk. “Most of the Ihmer speak nothing but their own native tongue, and it is so because the Ihmer do not travel outside of Hali, save for a few.” 

“And you are one of those few?” 

“I was taken away when I was seven summers grown, by a Seeker called Raidh Luahrn. He took me to their city they call Andvárin.” 

“Who are they?” he asked. 

“Seekers are just that… seekers… of knowledge, wisdom, lost arts. They took me so that I might teach them the secrets of the Ihmer and in turn they taught me how to read and write the Middern tongue. When I was fifteen Rhaid took me back to Hali and I never saw him again.” 

“What secrets do the Ihmer hold that might interest such an order?” 

“It would surprise you.” 

He gave her a shrug and glanced down at the bowl of water on his lap, the still liquid casting a reflection of what he could only assume was his own face. He stared into the water for a moment, absorbing his own appearance for what felt like the first time - his auburn locks of hair, the thin beard that covered his face and the hazel eyes that stared back at him. His chin was well sculpted and his cheekbones high, his sun-touched skin stained with dried mud. At least I’m not hideous.

“Do you recognize this?” Kalea held a dagger in her hand, the handle intricately carved with faces and symbols he didn’t recognize, the steel blade arching up with a curve. 

The sight of it felt familiar to him, but he was unable to remember why. “I think so… I think it’s mine.” 

“It was found next to your lifeless corpse.” 

“Give it to me,” he demanded. 

“Why would I give a weapon to an offering?” 

“Offering?” The word pressed on his chest. 

“We do not wish to be cruel. I know it may seem that way, but Naak-Akka demands the sacrifice of non-Ihmer, and your kind is not a common sight in Hali.” 

“Wait- what!” he shouted and tried to sit up straight but then realized his feet were bound to a pole at the end of the bed. “Why would you save my life if you intend to kill me?” 

“You cannot sacrifice something that is already dying,” she said, her eyes avoiding contact with his. 

“Please, Kalea,” he begged her to reconsider. 

“This is the way of the Ihmer, and even though I speak the Middern tongue, I am still Ihmer. Naak-Akka will take you into her bosom and nurture you in your death.”
