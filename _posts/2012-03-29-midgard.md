In the very center of the World Tree lies Midgard, the ancestral homeland of the Aesir and the current homeland of men. It is a world rife with war and other dangers, divided into numerous Kingdoms and Jarldoms. The Aesir were united under the rule of the Allfather, where as Men have lacked such unity ever since the fall of the High Kingdom.

Man may be dominant in Midgard, but the world is filled with creatures from other worlds. Some of these are benign, like the fabled Bu Alvar, while others see only the will to wreak havoc or deal death to those unfortunate enough to cross their paths.

It is the central and, one would argue, the most important world. It is the original homeland of the Aesir before they transitioned into godhood in Asgard, and the field for many world-shaking battles to come.

A little insight into the world of Midgard.

Thanks for reading!
