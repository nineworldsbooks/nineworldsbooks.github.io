It's been incredibly difficult to focus my efforts these past few weeks with so many projects on the to-do list. I've been working hard at getting my board game "Greyholt" ready for playtesting, so that is definitely the main culprit when it comes to stealing my attention away from writing, but fortunately only a few minor details are needed to get it print-ready and then I can begin work on my next literary piece "High-Thane".

High-Thane will be a mini-book series featuring the protagonist from Black Standards in his younger years. The reason I call it "mini-book" rather than short-story or novelette is because the size of each story may vary greatly. The first story in the series might be the size of a short-story while the one after that might be as big as a Novella. I don't want to be constrained by pre-determined sizes. I'll write each story as big as it essentially needs to be.

Before I can start writing High-Thane I have another task that I need to finish beforehand. Since High-Thane will be a prequel series to Black Standards I feel the need to revise and majorly edit Black Standards and fix everything that has been bugging me about it. I'll undergo that challenge soon enough, so keep an eye out for a revised edition of Black Standards sometime in the near future. The basic skeleton of the story will remain the same but I expect that the characters and dialogue will suffer the biggest changes. Hopefully for the better!

At the risk of sounding like an 80's radio host... Stay tuned!
