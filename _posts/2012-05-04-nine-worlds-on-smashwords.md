Blood &amp; Rain is now available on Smashwords.com <a title="Blood &amp; Rain" href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/157551" target="_blank">here</a>. I can hardly describe how nervous I feel about putting my stuff out on such a broad market. While I feel confident that my writing is good or at least a step in the direction to good, the thought of reviewers tearing it apart is worrying.

A lot of people have read my work so far but I've received little to no feedback on it so far. I gave out the three stories Blood &amp; Rain, Black Standards and The Road to Askeldúrin for free only asking those who can spare the time to provide me with a bit of feedback. I want to know what people think, what they liked and what they didn't like. Consider this a call out to diligent readers that are willing to bring to the table a bit of critique so I know what I'm doing right and what I'm doing wrong.

I'm in the process of revising Black Standards and The Road to Askeldúrin and once that's finished I'll post them up on smashwords (where all my work will be published henceforth.)

Thanks for reading!
