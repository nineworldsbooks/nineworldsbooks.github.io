I want to give a little preview of one of the major human states in Midgard, one featured heavily in High Thane, a novel in its planning stages.

<strong>The Gottish Kingdom</strong>

As High King Ydaron met his treacherous end and the High Kingdom of Isaford crumbled into the pages of history, Ydaron's closest relative and nephew, Edala, ventured south, past the great mountains Kardol and Korunth and into the wild lands of Gotland. In Gotland, Edala founded the Gottish Kingdom and, with help from the Bruhrim tribes of the south, erected the colossal "Ydaron's Wall" to separate Gotland from the Kingdom of Eldris, the new power in central Midgard that rose from the ashes of the fallen High Kingdom.

Today, the Gottish Kingdom is one of the major powers in Midgard alongside the Kingdom of Eldris and the Amattar Sovereignty. It is still a wild land, with no sight of cobbled roads or regular patrols, but held in civility by strict theocratic laws and cultural pride. The Gotts hold on tight to their traditions such as promoting strength in individuals through brutal training and grueling chores, shunning the cowardly and weak. They are influenced heavily by their long-term allies to the south, the Bruhrim tribes (half-men half-Jotnar) and are one of only a few regions where Bruhrim may venture through without being harassed or attacked.

It is an absolute monarchy that upholds the values of strength and bravery but has never been known to engage in war for the sake of territorial claim as they have no interest in any other territory than Gotland.

*"No matter the quality of insults, weapons you wield, or your prowess with either, you'll never find yourself striking fear into the heart of a true Gott..."*  
**- Leograin Koltar, Second High Thane of Gotland.**
