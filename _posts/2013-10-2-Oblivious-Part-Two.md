“No!” Tau screamed and thrashed around in the bed, ignoring the sharp pain in his abdomen. 

“You cannot resist the will of Naak-Akka,” said Kalea, calm as a spring.

“To hell with your god! And to hell with you!” He reached for his feet, grabbed at the ropes and pulled them apart with surprisingly little effort. As he looked to Kalea he saw her calm expression had washed away, replaced by confusion and fear. “I don’t want to hurt you,” he said as he placed his feet on the ground, “but I will if you don’t stay out of my way.” 

“I cannot…” She held the blade in her right hand, trembling slightly as she stared at him. 

“You can.” He stood up, his left hand supporting the wound on his stomach. 

“My duty-“ 

“Your duty is none of my concern!” yelled Tau. “You hold no control over my destiny! And neither does your god!” As he felt himself anger he could feel heat rushing through his body, as if his blood had begun boiling. 

“Goddess,” she corrected him. 

“I don’t care,” he muttered. 

“When faced with death does the mouse tell the owl that it holds no control over its destiny?” She gave a sweet and disturbing smile. “Perhaps you are right,” she said, dropping the blade down to her side. “Maybe it is not your destiny to die at the hands of the Ihmer. Perhaps it is. Your words will not alter destiny. The threads of the worlds are already woven.” 

He eyed the blade in her relaxed hand. “Your words do not sound like something your goddess teaches.” 

“I learned more than merely the Middern tongue in my time with the Seekers.” She flipped the blade around in her hand and extended the hilt towards him. “Here, take your blade and leave. We shall see if it is your destiny to live.” 

Tau narrowed his eyes, regarding her with suspicion before slowly reaching over to take the knife from her hand. “Thank you,” he said and quickly nodded before hurrying out of the hut. 

The cold evening air kissed at his naked flesh. It was dark outside, early evening by the looks of the sun cresting on the horizon. In one direction he saw fires and people moving around while in the other he noticed trees in the distance rising above the city. He made for the trees, edging along flapping walls and hiding behind carriages and other obstacles whenever Ihmer eyes turned in his direction. 

After sneaking through a maze of huts, bare and confused, he looked upon the first tree up close and couldn’t help releasing a sigh of relief as he grasped at the tree with his right hand while holding the painful wound on his stomach with the other. *I made it*. 

A twig snapped behind him and before he could turn around to see what it was something hit the back of his head, knocking him to the ground. With his vision blurred he felt the world fading to darkness around him, catching a glimpse of two pairs of feet in front of him right as he drifted away.
