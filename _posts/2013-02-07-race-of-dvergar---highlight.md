<em>From the same seed as men, they were born in the dark.</em>

From stone-crusted roots they emerged, naked, strong, proud and wise. The Dvergar, like the race of men, were born from Thor's Oak. But while men were embraced by natural light native only to the surface, the Dvergar were condemned by their racial origin to the vast depths of the underworld known as Nidarvellr. For ages the Dvergar made the darkness of Eord their home, crafting and building, unaware of the existence of a surface above. 

The time eventually came that curiosity pushed their ascent and the Dvergar discovered what lay beyond the insides of mountains. But the ones who daringly took their first steps out into the light were surprisingly and tragically turned to stone by a harsh golden mistress that loomed from the sky. Whether it was due to their lifelong stay in dark places or if it had been intended since the first days by the forces of destiny was unknown. It became apparent that the Dvergar would never be able to meet the sun and live to tell the tale. As was in their nature, the Dvergar didn't seem bothered by it and accepted the fact as something beyond their control, eventually turning to settling the vast underworld in which they were meant to be at home in. 

They built vast kingdoms beneath the earth and erected gargantuan cities that stood as timeless monuments for ages to come. The largest cities were each ruled by a sovereign entity known as a Dain, a title much like a King. To ensure the prosperity of the Dvergar kingdoms, some of these Dains banded together and formed unions to solidify their defenses against beasts and dangerous creatures that lurked in the depths of Nidarvellr. 

While most Dvergar are content with ruling the darkness and never stepping into the sun, there are those who are more adventurous and use the cover of the moon to travel across the surface, whether to bypass dangerous routes below, or to trade with fortunate humans. This practice has given way to a religion celebrating the moon or Mani as they call him, the guardian of the race of Dvergar, and enemy of the unrelenting sun.
