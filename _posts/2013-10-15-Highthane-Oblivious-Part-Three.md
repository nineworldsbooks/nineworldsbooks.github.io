His eyes slowly creaked open and the wide night sky revealed itself, dimpled with stars. He was on his back, lying on something cold and hard. He turned his head and saw Kalea standing over him, a smile on her face. 

“It would seem that destiny has spoken,” she said. 

“I’m not dead yet,” replied Tau. His hands and feet were extended to every corner of what looked like some sort of stone table, firmly bound in place. He shifted his head around as best he could to catch a glance of his surroundings. At both of his sides were other stone tables, one empty while the other was occupied by a young girl, hardly older than fifteen. She was blonde and he could see she was fair despite her blushed, tear-soaked cheeks and bloodshot eyes. Around them was a crowd of people, pale folk with dark expressions, their attention focused on him and the girl. “Who’s the girl?” he asked. 

“Another offering,” replied Kalea. “The Tayvari found her on the outskirts of Hali, alone picking goose berries into a basket.”

“You’re going to kill her?” 

“She is an offering, like you. Most likely a virgin, which pleases Naak-Akka even more.”

“You already have an offering! You have me…” he said, thrashing around in his ropes. “You don’t need her.”

“You see three altars, do you not?” She stared him in the eyes, a hard look on her face. “The Aisti ritual is done with three offerings, but we have only two so that shall need to suffice. A single offering would be a grave insult to the great lady.” 

“An insult?” He gave a hearty laugh. “I hope I do meet your goddess when this is all over, so that I can rip out her throat and piss on her corpse!” 

“Stooping to verbal insults is a sign of fear and desperation,” answered Kalea. “You will not anger the-“

The hauntingly high-pitched sound of a horn interrupted her and snapped her attention away from Tau.

“Veesha talarin kuol ka!” came a male voice, hoarse and weak. A man approached the altars, his movement slow and careful, his back slightly curved. He wore a black gown, decorated by metal shards on strings and his face was hidden by a disturbing mask of bones. He addressed the crowd with a lethargic flourish of his arms, and a long speech that Tau had little comprehension of, but the mass of people held on to his every word, like children to a parent. Once the speech was done the man approached Kalea and handed her three oval-shaped stones, perfectly smooth. 

“What the hell…” Tau asked himself. 

Kalea approached the young girl that was bound on the table next to Tau, her hands clasped around the three small stones. Tau felt his heart pounding harder with each step Kalea took. He had a twisted feeling in his stomach and he knew something vile was about to happen.

The girl cried and screamed, curdling the blood in his veins. The crowd of people seemed unaffected by the horrid screams and simply stared ahead. Even the children’s faces were devoid of emotion. Only Kalea showed anything resembling feelings - a barely noticeable expression on her face that seemed to imply a bit of uncertainty as she made her way to the young girl. He watched the crowd, hoping someone would step up, shout in objection or storm the stage, but they never did. They can’t all be this twisted and vile. They can’t be. The children didn’t smile and they didn’t run around as children should. They watched the girl cry and scream as if it was a routine occurrence, solemn faces painted with black, vertical stripes. 

Kalea gently stroked the girl’s cheek, and for a moment it almost seemed as if she cared. Kalea smiled down at her and for a moment the girl stopped screaming, granting herself a respite to stare into Kalea’s eyes. The first stone Kalea placed on the girl’s navel, the second on her upper abdomen and the third between her bare breasts. And then she walked away, breaking eye contact quickly and decisively and disappearing out of sight. The girl looked around for a moment, desperate to find the one pair of eyes she seemed to trust.

The man in the bone mask approached the girl’s table. Grasping the edge with his pale, bony fingers he leaned over, his head hovering above the navel stone. The girl looked equally afraid and confused, moaning slightly, but she did not scream. Then a haunting voice came from the man’s lips, as loud as a shout and as sharp as a whisper. It was not his voice, but something unnatural and terrifying that spoke through him. 

Silence overwhelmed the area. 

“No, no!” the girl began to scream, each one louder and more terrible than the one before. 

Suddenly, Kalea was by Tau’s side, holding three other stones that looked identical to the ones she had placed on the girl. She stared at him, paying no heed to the young girl’s cries for help. 

“What’s happening to her?” Tau asked her. 

“Searing stones,” said Kalea, motioning at the stones in her hands, “brought over the Shallow Sea from Ordos. They respond to specific chants by heating themselves almost to the temperature of molten lava, while remaining in solid form.” She placed the stones on his naked stomach as she spoke, in the same alignment as she had done on the girl. 

“Get them off me!” he shouted for a moment but turned silent as he looked across at the other table and saw how the stones there had turned bright red, smoke pluming from the girl’s skin. The smell of charcoal filled the atmosphere and his stomach churned. The stones began to sink into the girl’s skin until they had disappeared completely into her body, her final screams muffled by breathless pain. “Monsters!” He thrashed around, trying hard to tip the stones off his stomach, but no matter how hard he tried they seemed to persistently stick to his skin like rock-hard leeches. 

“You will understand our ways when you meet Naak-Akka,” said Kalea, before vanishing from sight yet again.

The man in the bone mask approached, leaning over his body as he had done with the girl and whispering in that unnatural voice that made Tau’s throat close up and the hairs on his body rise. I will not scream… I will not cry… I will not beg. He closed his eyes and prepared himself for the painful death that awaited him. After a while he could feel the stones burn, but they did not burn him, they did not hurt him. In fact, he liked the heat on his skin. It felt as if something divine kissed at his flesh.

He could hear people gasping and speaking amongst themselves. Curious, he opened his eyes and saw the stones burning bright red on his stomach. His entire body was smoldering and exuding smoke. The ropes around his hands and his feet had burned to ashes. He felt a strange sense of power from all this heat and he couldn’t quite explain it, but the fact that those searing stones had not burned holes through his body made him grin as he raised himself up, brushing the stones to the floor. 

The tall man in the black robe removed his mask of bones, revealing a gaunt face with eyes wide in confusion and a jaw drooping low. He spoke something low, filled with stutters and words that Tau did not know. 

Kalea stepped forth, her face as equally surprised as the man’s. “He says… that you cannot be offered to Naak-Akka.” 

“Now, don’t mistake my curiosity for dissatisfaction but,” he began, brushing the smoke off his skin. “Why not?”

“Because you are not a man…”
