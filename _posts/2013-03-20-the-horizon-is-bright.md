What's going on? I received this question the other day. Someone asking me what the situation is on the Bastion and so forth... 

Allow me to list up a little progress report. 

 * **The Bastion** - 1st draft complete. Under revision.
 * **Mists of Llorn (Short story)** - 1st draft nearing completion.
 * **Blood &amp; Rain** - Unpublished for further revisions. 
 * **The Road to Askeldúrin** - Unpublished for further revisions. 
 * **Black Standards** - Unpublished for further revisions. </strong>

What's all this about unpublishing? Well, my short-stories were self-published a good while ago. The views/downloads were fairly good but after a recent glance at them I decided they were not as good as they can be and improperly reflected the world I've created. 

So what's next? 

 1. I will complete Mists of Llorn and pitch it to several magazines and online publications. 
 2. This goes hand in hand with nr. 1, as I will continue revising the Bastion with help from Scribophile.com while I'm working on Mists of Llorn. 
 3. Re-write Blood &amp; Rain. 
 4. Re-write The Road to Askeldúrin. 
 5. Re-write Black Standards. </strong>

This to-do list is subject to change of course, but it gives an idea of where I'm headed.
