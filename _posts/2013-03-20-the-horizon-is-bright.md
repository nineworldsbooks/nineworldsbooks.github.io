What's going on? I received this question the other day. Someone asking me what the situation is on the Bastion and so forth... 

Allow me to list up a little progress report. 

<strong>The Bastion - 1st draft complete. Under revision. 
Mists of Llorn (Short story) - 1st draft nearing completion. 
Blood &amp; Rain - Unpublished for further revisions. 
The Road to Askeldúrin - Unpublished for further revisions. 
Black Standards - Unpublished for further revisions. </strong>

What's all this about unpublishing? Well, my short-stories were self-published a good while ago. The views/downloads were fairly good but after a recent glance at them I decided they were not as good as they can be and improperly reflected the world I've created. 

So what's next? 

<strong>1. I will complete Mists of Llorn and pitch it to several magazines and online publications. 
2. This goes hand in hand with nr. 1, as I will continue revising the Bastion with help from Scribophile.com while I'm working on Mists of Llorn. 
3. Re-write Blood &amp; Rain. 
4. Re-write The Road to Askeldúrin. 
5. Re-write Black Standards. </strong>

This to-do list is subject to change of course, but it gives an idea of where I'm headed. 

Stay tuned on the facebook page or nineworldsbooks.com (or both!)
