Two years ago, a little idea popped into my head. I‘ve always dreamed, ever since I was a kid, of creating my very own fictional universe. I made several attempts at it in my free time throughout the years but always ended up feeling unsatisfied and metaphorically crumpling it up and tossing it into a round metal bin. These failed attempts however, only served to teach me some very valuable lessons in regards to world-building, one in particular: World-building is hard. It makes you appreciate more how much work Tolkien for example actually did to make his world believable. As I said, two years ago I had an idea, and it was one that I liked quite a lot. A fantasy universe based upon my favourite mythology of all: Norse.

My name is Rúnar Thor, but you might come to know me better under my pseudonym R.Thor. I come from a small island in Scandinavia called “Iceland”, a place of wonderful mythology. I grew up hearing about stories of tiny elves living inside rocks and I remember my parents pointing out large boulders as we drove through the country, telling me those boulders were trolls touched by the sun and turned to stone. You could say that my homeland is my greatest inspiration when it comes to writing.

I just thought I should share a few welcoming words here. Wasn’t my intention to write up a biography on myself, so I’ll leave it at this and hope you’ll enjoy reading my stories as much as I enjoy writing them. Don’t forget to visit the forums and sign up if you feel like becoming a part of my lovely community. You can post your opinions on the stories and discuss the world in general.

I give away my short-stories for free, simply because I don't think I'm at the stage yet where I can actually start selling them. I'm still learning, which is why I hope to receive  honest opinions from those who take the time to read my works. After all, the greatest gift a writer receives is constructive criticism.

**Best regards,  
R. Thor**
